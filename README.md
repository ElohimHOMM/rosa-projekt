# rosa-projekt
This is an extension of Sarah's THI project about creating and managing tasks.

## How To Start DB and Service: 
Run Database by using
```sh
flask --app flaskr init-db
```

Then start the app by using
```sh
flask --app flaskr run
```
This all works on the projects root level
 
We now have hot redeployments, when you change the contents of e.g. HTML you can just save that and reload the browser without having to restart the service.
Ctrl + C in the console stops the project
